{"name":"Sharedrop","tagline":"Easily share files using your own server","body":"ShareDrop is a system that eases file sharing on Linux, provided you've got\r\nyour own server to store the files.\r\n\r\nIt works by monitoring a folder for file creation or modification and by\r\nautomatically and securely copying these files to your web server through\r\n`scp`.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* bash (tested with 4.2.42)\r\n* ssh (tested with OpenSSH 6.1)\r\n* sha1sum (tested with the version from GNU coreutils 8.21)\r\n* inotify-tools (tested with 3.14)\r\n* notify-send (tested with the version from libnotify 0.7.5)\r\n* A web server\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n-----\r\n\r\nShareDrop needs some (quite easy) setup.\r\n\r\n1. Define a VirtualHost (or equivalent) on your Web server that allows serving\r\n   files from a given directory\r\n2. Write a config file for ShareDrop (see below)\r\n3. Run `sharedrop.sh`\r\n4. Drop files in the folder you launched ShareDrop in\r\n5. Wait for the notification giving you an URL for your file\r\n\r\nPersistent setup\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nYou may also want to automatically run ShareDrop on session start. You can give\r\na path to ShareDrop to monitor as the first argument of the command. This should\r\nease setting up your session manager.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nShareDrop is configured through a `config.sh` file in a standard configuration\r\nfolder (if you haven't tweaked `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` then it's likely to be in\r\n`$HOME/.config/sharedrop/`). This file must define two bash variables:\r\n\r\n  * `$REMOTE`: an `scp` remote folder specification (such as\r\n    `example.com:public_html/`)\r\n  * `$BASE_URL`: the URL for the VirtualHost you configured in your web server\r\n    (e.g.: `http://example.com/share/`)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
